# daily-planner

I built a code daily planner because I thought it would be a fun and useful project.

## This project was incredibly challenging.  It tested my wits, and made me think outside the box.


### J query
	This project taught me how to use J Query to the best of my ability. I used everything that I learned in Javascript and spent hours looking up the J query syntax. This project taught me to think like a program.
